**this is a program I made so I can leave my computer running programs overnight without anyone being able to go onto my computer.**

# installation instructions:
download lock.exe from releases, or download it from main (this has a chance to include a bug, but is more up to date) to download from command line use the url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reedthorngag/device-lock/main/lock.exe or https://github.com/reedthorngag/device-lock/releases/download/v1.0/lock.exe to get the release.
then run lock.exe from the dstination folder, and it will automatically download dependencies into a bin folder inside the folder you ran lock.exe in.
it will also ask you for a password to use, which it will enter as **plain text** into a file called password.txt in bin, you can change the password by changing the value in this file.

# disclaimer:
**I do not garrentee that this will prevent people from getting onto your computer, there are always ways around, especially for something like this.** (see https://github.com/reedthorngag/device-lock/issues/1 )
