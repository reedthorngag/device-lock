**this is a program I made so I can leave my computer running programs overnight without anyone being able to go onto my computer.**

# to install and run:
download the sleep.exe file from https://github.com/reedthorngag/device-lock/releases/tag/v1.0 and run it, it will set itself up automatically, and ask you for a password to use, note that this password is currently stored as plain text in a file called password.txt in the same folder that you ran this in, to change the password, change the password in that file.
**note: this downloads dependancies/nesassery files into the folder that you run this in! if you want this stored in it's own folder, you will have to create that folder yourself, and move sleep.exe into it and run it.**

# disclaimer:
**I do not garrentee that this will prevent people from getting onto your computer, there are always ways around, especially for something like this.**
